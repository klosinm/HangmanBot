A bot on Discord that can ask one user for a word or phrase and have the other users in the server guess before its too late! (or they get 10 wrong guesses)

<br/>

## Start game: <br/>
A User inputs a word with the command
```
h/new game ||word or phrase||
``` 
By asking the user to surround the word for others to guess with "||", discord blocks the word from being visable.<br/>
In the example below, game word to guess is "cat":<br/>
